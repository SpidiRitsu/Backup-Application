# Frontend

Frontend is built using [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) web components. 

All components logic is handled by [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) library.

## Usage

You can serve frontend by:
```bash
polymer serve
```

## Building

Building frontend is easily done by `npm run build`. All built files are going straight into `/backend/app/static/` folder.
